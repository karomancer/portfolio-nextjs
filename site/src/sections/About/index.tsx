          <h2>Hello World, I'm Karina! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
          <br />
          I'm a creative technologist that loves exploring the intersection of
          art, psychology, and technology and creating meaningful and joyful
          experiences through games and products.
          <br />
          In the last couple of years I've been tinkering with mixed reality,
          e-textiles, algo/AI art, and projection mapping. In May, I received my
          Masters of Professional Studies in{" "}
          <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/itp/" target="_blank">
            Interactive Telecommunications
          </a>{" "}
          at <strong>New York University</strong>.
          <br />
          Professionally, my work currently ranges from frontend engineering and
          mobile app development to graphic design and illustration, pitch deck
          preparation, and animation work. I typically work with small startups
          ranging from pre-seed to series B, utilizing all my skills to build
          prototypes and full fledged products. Today, I have a couple
          subcontractors to help me better serve my clients under my own
          company, <strong>KACHOW! LLC</strong>.
          <br />
          For over a decade, I worked as a software engineer in San Francisco:
          as a data engineer at <strong>Yammer</strong>, a frontend engineer at{" "}
          <strong>Honor</strong>, and a frontend infrastructure team leader at{" "}
          <strong>Patreon</strong>. I've spoken both at conferences about
          frontend infrastructure, design systems, as well as conferences about
          disabilities, accessibility, and mental health in tech.
          <br />
          Previously, I got my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and{" "}
          <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">
            Human-Computer Interaction
          </a>{" "}
          from <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong>.
