          ðŸ‘‹ Hello World, I'm <b>Karina Chow</b>
          <br />
          I'm a San Francisco-based creative technologist, software developer,
          artist, and designer that sits at the intersection of art and
          technology.
          <br />
          My work ranges from frontend engineering and mobile app development to
          graphic design and illustration, pitch deck preparation, and animation
          work. I typically work with small startups ranging from pre-seed to
          series B, utilizing all my skills to build prototypes and full fledged
          products. Today, I have a couple subcontractors to help me better
          serve my clients under my own company, <strong>KACHOW! LLC</strong>
          <br />
          In the last couple of years, I've also been exploring mixed reality,
          e-textiles, algo/AI art, and projection mapping. In May, I received my
          masters degree in{" "}
          <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/itp/" target="_blank">
            Interactive Telecommunications
          </a>{" "}
          at <strong>New York University</strong>. You can see these
          explorations in my <Link href="/portfolio">portfolio</Link> and{" "}
          <Link href="/blog">blog</Link>.
          <br />
          Prior to grad school and starting my own business, I spent a decade as
          a software engineer in San Francisco. I worked as a data engineer at{" "}
          <strong>Yammer</strong>, a frontend engineer at <strong>Honor</strong>
          , and a frontend infrastructure team leader at{" "}
          <strong>Patreon</strong>. I've spoken both at conferences about
          frontend infrastructure, design systems, as well as disabilities,
          accessibility, and mental health in tech.
          <br />I received my <strong>Bachelor of Science</strong> in{" "}
          <a

          and{" "}
