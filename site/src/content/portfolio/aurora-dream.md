Rabbits are one of my favorite animals. So when [Aurora Dream Rabbitry](https://adrabbitry.weebly.com/) asked me to help them design business cards just in time for the [American Rabbit Breeder's Association Rabbit](https://arba.net/) Show, I was thrilled to draw some bun buns.

If you've never heard of the ARBA annual rabbit show, I would recommend watching this video:

### Business Card Rough Drafts
Aurora Dream Rabbitry is run by a pair of friends. My initial thought was to make stylish caricatures of them for their business cards.

![The image is a business card design for "Aurora Dream Rabbitry." It features a simple line drawing of two individuals holding rabbits. The text includes the names "Corinne Foote & Rachel Trujillo" and provides contact information: an email address (AuroraDreamRabbits@gmail.com) and a website (ADRabbity.Weebly.com). The card has a clean layout with the business name prominently displayed in a decorative green font, creating a professional appearance for the rabbitry.](/portfolio/aurora-dream/businesscard.png)
![The image shows three individuals standing together in a spacious indoor setting, likely at an event or fair. One person is holding a large white rabbit, which is resting on their arm. The other two individuals are positioned beside them, wearing casual clothing. The background features a structure with overhead lighting and several animal pens, indicating a livestock or pet exhibition environment. The overall scene captures a moment of interaction with the rabbit in a communal space.](/portfolio/aurora-dream/friends.jpg)

The background is minimal, focusing on the subjects and their pets. The overall composition captures a moment of companionship between the individuals and the animals.](/portfolio/aurora-dream/friends_illustration.jpg)

They weren't too into the idea of caricatures of themselves, and they pivoted from the idea of a business card design. What they really wanted, they said, was an illustration of a rabbit they could use for their logo.

### Character Illustration
So I went to work in making iterations of rabbit illustrations. They gave me a reference photo afterwards to use in future iterations.

![The image features a collection of eight cartoon-style illustrations of fluffy animals, each labeled with letters A through H. The animals have round bodies and fluffy fur, resembling a mix of sheep and rabbits. - **A**: A fluffy animal with a serious expression and black ears. - **B**: A similar fluffy creature with a playful expression. - **C**: A round, fluffy animal with a closed-eyed smile. - **D**: A fluffy animal with a confident stance and upright ears. - **E**: A fluffy creature with rabbit ears and a curious expression. - **F**: A fluffy animal with a slightly grumpy look. - **G**: A fluffy creature with large eyes and a neutral expression. - **H**: A fluffy animal with a mix of features, looking inquisitive. The illustrations are outlined in black and lack color, emphasizing their shapes and expressions.](/portfolio/aurora-dream/8up.png)
![The image features a fluffy rabbit with a mix of light brown and gray fur, giving it a soft, cloud-like appearance. Its ears are upright, and it has a small, rounded face with dark eyes. The rabbit is sitting on a green surface, with a hint of an orange ball visible in the background. The backdrop consists of a light green wall, adding a gentle contrast to the rabbit's fur. The overall scene captures the rabbit in a calm and adorable pose.](/portfolio/aurora-dream/original.jpg)

Its ears are upright, and it has large, expressive eyes. The rabbit is depicted in a sitting position, showcasing its rounded body and fluffy tail. The overall design emphasizes the rabbit's adorable features and fluffy texture, set against a plain white background.](/portfolio/aurora-dream/final.jpg)

## ARBA and Merch
The final design is a Disney-fied version of the reference photo they gave me. It was made in time for the ARBA show, and was used for both rabbit designations and merch. If you like the design, consider [buying some stickers](https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/Lionhead-Rabbit-by-karinachowtime/67474065.JCQM3)!

Our illustration gracing the cage of our star show bunny:
![The image shows a fluffy rabbit inside a wire cage at a rabbit show. The rabbit has a light brown coat with a fluffy mane, characteristic of a Lionhead breed. A sign attached to the cage reads "Aurora Dream Rabbitry" and provides details about the rabbit named "Astra." The sign lists the breed as Lionhead, variety as Black Tort, age as Junior, sex as Doe, and includes an ear number. The cage contains a small food dish and a water container, with bedding visible on the bottom. The setting appears to be a rabbit show or sale event.](/portfolio/aurora-dream/arba.jpg)
