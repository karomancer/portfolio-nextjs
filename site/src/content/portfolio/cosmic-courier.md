For my New Arcade class at ITP, our final was to create a full Unity game and arcade cabinet. I worked on the controllers as well, but given this is Dribbble, I'll only show the art assets I made.

In our game “Cosmic Couriers”, you play cooperatively as a team of 3 on a ship making deliveries. Your goal as a team is to make as many deliveries as you can to the astronauts with flags before being defeated by the dangers of space.

The arcade cabinet itself is shaped like a pirate ship and has 3 stations for your teammates: one captain and two cannoneers. **The Captain** is in charge of maneuvering the ship away from enemies and to waiting customers. The two **Cannoneers** are tasked with taking down enemies that threaten your delivery operations.

I was personally in charge of defining art direction and making in-game assets. I also worked on the physical cannon controllers and exterior design via CAD and 3D printing.

## Background Assets

To a space pirate, space is the ocean! So it only makes sense that in a game about space pirates, the backdrop should be a combination of ocean and space.

I created a base layer in Photoshop with compositing ocean and space photographs. Then I created illustrations of ocean ripples and waves and used that as a mask over my rasterized texture, then made my own star brush in Illustrator and finished it off with space details.

I did this a few times, and some of the results were trippier than I bargained for, but I'm largely happy with where it ended up!
