## Context
All my coworkers at a previous job were obsessed with fighting games, specifically Street Fighter II and Marvel vs. Capcom. I love fighting games too; I had already cosplayed as Tira from Soul Calibur III at this point.

Morrigan is a powerful succubus from a Capcom game called Dark Stalkers. She's a fighter in Marvel vs. Capcom, so I decided to dress up as her for our work holiday party to surprise my coworkers.

## Fabrication

### Making the leotard
Morrigan's leotard is very basic. the only special thing is that there's a heart shape cutout just below her bust. After cutting it, I decided to fill it with a tan colored fabric; I don't exactly have cleavage to show off.

A strip of white feathers was sewn onto the edges later.

### Making the butt wings
Her butt wings are really the most challenging part of the costume. I decided to carve the wings out of upholstery foam used for furniture. The spines of the wings got thick armature wires used for heavy clay sculptures, and the spans between the spine were carved down thinner so they would move more in the wind.

Grooves were carved out of the spines so that the armature wire could fit in it. The added advantage of doing it this way is also that the wings are moldable; to help me fit through doors but also so they can be moved into different poses.

Then, like a piece of furniture, I made a covering out of fabric to upholster around the foam.

At first, I thought I wanted to connect the wings separately to a harness. However, given that Morrigan wears a pretty skimpy leotard, I couldn't figure out how to attach a harness without it being seen. So what I did instead was reconnect the wings using rubber bands and tape and create a giant elastic harness to be worn below the leotard.

Lastly, the top of her wings have white talons. I sculpted these out of Model Magic foam clay and super glued them on.

### Making the head wings
Morrigan also has tiny head wings. I did the same technique as the big wings, but on a much smaller scale. I then taped them to a teal headband that blended into the wig.

### Making everything else
There's a few things I didn't get pictures of for whatever reason.

- The "gloves" were sewn from orange fabric, and a piece of yarn was attached so that it could be tied around my middle finger
- Purple tights were bought, and I made a bat stencil to airbrush bats onto them
- I bought a teal wig and cut it myself, but clearly I had no idea what I was doing because the back is a mess (see the back picture)
- Shoes were bought at Goodwill

## Final costume

The final costume! Some pictures show how the costume is intended to be, while others are the SFW version for work.
