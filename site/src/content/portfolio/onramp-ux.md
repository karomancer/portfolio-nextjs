## About Onramp

The world of freight trucking is highly complex with many different actors. Truckers themselves can be part of a much larger corporate owned fleet, or can be sole proprietors themselves.

Many different aspects of a freight trucking operation include payment, and in many cases the payment method differs. Diesel purchases are often done via (company) credit card while lumper payments are done through cash or [COMCHEKs](https://www.comdata.com/products-services/comchek/). Each scenario has a large cast of actors each with their own motivations and strong financial security implications.

[Onramp](https://onrampcard.com/) is a startup aiming to enable the future of freight through payments and financial technology by automating payments and optimizing prices, efficiency, and security for all parties in the freight ecosystem.

In 2020, I worked with their CEO and founder [Michael Morris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdbmorris/) to develop out a few concepts for their first set of products, namely their flagship Fuel Pay product which rewards freight drivers for fueling diesel and reefer at partner diesel stations, like [Love's](https://www.loves.com/) and [Pilot Flying J](https://pilotflyingj.com/).

## Design Projects

All designs and interactive prototypes were made within Figma.

### Fuelpay

Onramp's primary desired feature was a way for freight truck drivers to pay for diesel via the Onramp app or with the Onramp Card.

Onramp's goal was to partner with multiple companies in the space, such as Ryder's or Pilot Flying J, and create a points reward system similar to credit cards that incentivizes drivers to refill their diesel and [reefer fuel](https://fosterfuels.com/reefer-trailer-fueling-services) at partnering stations.

Rewards might include Walmart gift cards, free food at participating restaurants, showers, and other truck stop-specific rewards.

The flow included the trucker planning out their route on a map within the app and being directed to a participating partner fueling station. From there, they would be directed via the app to refill their diesel or reefer, pay for any additional needed services, and complete the transaction all via the app.

### Lumper payments

In the freight trucking world, a [**lumper**](https://www.relaypayments.com/blog/what-is-a-lumper-and-lumper-payment) is a laborer that (un)loads cargo at the destination point.

Say you're a freight trucker that's transporting West Elm furniture across the country. Once you arrive at a West Elm, professional lumpers greet you to load and unload the furniture.

These laborers are often not hired by West Elm themselves but are rather independent contractors that are paid by the freight driver themselves. This amount is often comped by the vendor, but not always.

Because lumpers are independent professionals, they often want to be paid in cash or with [COMCHEKs](https://www.comdata.com/products-services/comchek/). ComChecks are checks created by [COMDATA](https://www.comdata.com/) that lumpers can deposit near immediately. COMDATA largely has a monopoly on lumper payments.

In addition to their FuelPay feature, Onramp wanted to explore the idea of lumper payments within their platform, so I set off to create the flow.
