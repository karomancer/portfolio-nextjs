## Context

One of my favorite game series of all time is Soul Calibur, a fighting game made by Namco. Many of the weapon moves are based on real life martial art styles, and as a martial artist myself it's really fun to see.

That being said, some characters are just wacky and non-sensical. Soul Calibur III introduced this Harley Quinn-like character named Tira. She's pure Chaotic Neutral and attacks people with a giant hula hoop of death. As soon as I saw her, I knew I had to dress up as her.

Instead of dressing up alone though, I convinced a few of my friends to dress up as other women in the franchise with me for Fanime. Most of them are also martial artists/lovers of the game, so it wasn't a hard sell.

## The Process

### Making the Outfit

Tira's outfit looks like a bunch of pieces of cloth that's only staying together because of a single piece of yarn.

I took a green T-Shirt, and cut along where the seams are in her outfit. Then, I connected them back together with a maroon ribbon. Lastly, I cut up an old jacket for the cuffs, attached those to the sleeves, and sewed a green feather boa around the neck.

For the pants, I found a pair of white pants at Goodwill for $3 and dyed them green/teal. I traced my hand and arm and made a pattern for the gloves.

Lastly, I bought a bunch of plastic flower pots at Orchard Supply Hardware, covered them in duct tape, and painted them for the shin and knee guards.

### Making the Ring Blade

Tira has a mighty strange weapon: a giant, sharp hula hoop of death. I definitely wanted to do it justice, but I had a very limited budget, so I had to get creative.

I used a hula hoop as the base and covered it with pipe insulation. I cut the blades out of poster board and slotted those into the slits in the pipe insulation, then tapped the blades onto it.

### Doing the makeup

I don't really wear much makeup...and don't really know how to apply it. So practicing the makeup is actually a huge deal to me.

### "Making" the wig
I also couldn't find the right color wig. Since the dying of the pants went so well, I bought a white wig and tried to dye it teal...

## Final costume

We brought our costumes to Fanime. People even asked me for photo ops for their blogs!
