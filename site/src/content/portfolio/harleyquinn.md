## Context

As a 90s kid, I grew up a huge fan of [Batman: The Animated Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Animated_Series) and Harley Quinn was always one of my favorite characters. 2022 marked Harley Quinn's 30th birthday of her inception as a character for the show, so what better way to celebrate than to dress up as her for [New York Comic Con](https://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/)?

## The Process

This cosplay was pretty straightforward as the only technique was sewing and the only materials were fabrics. Instead of boring you with details, here's a little montage of some of the work that went into it.

I unfortunately didn't get to sewing on her diamonds, but even her greatest fans at the con didn't notice!
