[Chris Eminizer](https://www.chriseminizer.com/bio) is an all-around musician: saxophonist, pianist, singer, and percussionist. He contacted me as he was working on his second album, *Over Hills and Underground*, and asked if I would make his album art for him.

He had already taken photographs that he wanted featured in the design, and said he wanted white sketch overlays that resembled ghostly apparitions. He didn't have particular motifs in mind, but gave me all the lyrics for the album's songs beforehand for inspiration.

## Drafts

The title *Over Hills and Underground* is already very descriptive as-is, he had a song called "Angel's Wings", and there were lyrical references to Snow White. I decided to play with all of those ideas.

I had never made an eco-wallet before, so there was a lot of experimentation to be done with the shape:

The Eco-wallet was printed on glossy paper with an updated version of the design after a few prints.

## More information

Now, many years later, the album is available on Spotify. If this project intrigued you at all, give it a listen!
